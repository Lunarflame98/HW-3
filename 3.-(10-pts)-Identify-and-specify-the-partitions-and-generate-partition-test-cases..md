Inputs for partition:
k, list  
partitions for k:
* k<=0 No elements considered
* k<length of list Only the first k elements of the list are considered
* k=length of list All elements of the list are considered.
* k> length of list All elements of the list are considered and there aren't any more since the length is min(k,list.length)  
Partition for list:
* Empty list {}
* List with one element {x}
* List with multiple elements{x1,x2,x3}
* List containing negative, zero, and positive numbers
* List containing duplicates {x,x}
* List with very large integers
