In the class Average, there is an int 'k' and a list of integers 'list'. There are also ints 'average' and 'n'. 'n' will either take the whole list, or just the first k ints. Int 'i' starts at zero. Then, while int 'i'<'n', the average will increase by whatever int is in the respective index place for i. Once 'i' is no longer less than 'n', average will be divided by n to get the final result, which will be an integer.
